# Smart Building Energy Optimization

**Real-time streaming, cybersecurity and agentic AI for smart-building energy management.**

Final-year engineering project. A simulated multi-zone building streams sensor data through
Apache Kafka. Independent workers persist the data to PostgreSQL, predict energy use with ML,
optimise HVAC and lighting, and detect cyberattacks, anomalies and data drift. An agentic AI
proposes corrective actions, and every action must pass a deterministic safety layer before it
is executed. A Flask + Socket.IO dashboard shows everything live.

## Architecture

```
simulator (producer) ──► sensor.readings ─┬─► db_writer ─────────────► PostgreSQL
attack simulator ─────► (injects into)    ├─► ml_worker ──► energy.predictions
weather / carbon APIs ─► external.context ├─► security_worker ──► security.alerts
                                          └─► optimizer ──► control.recommendations
agent (LangGraph) ◄── alerts ──► agent.proposals ──► safety layer ──► control.commands ──► simulator
Flask + Socket.IO dashboard ◄── dashboard bridge (Kafka → Socket.IO) + PostgreSQL history
```

Design rules:
- Kafka is the event backbone.
- Each worker is its own process.
- Flask never consumes Kafka directly.
- AI actions are always validated by the safety layer before they run.

## Project structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config.py` | Central, environment-driven configuration (Flask, Socket.IO, Kafka, PostgreSQL, logging) |
| `utils/logging_config.py` | Structured JSON/text logging, one log file per service |
| `app.py` | Flask application factory (wiring only) |
| `scripts/check_environment.py` | Verifies Python, packages, configuration and service connectivity |
| `simulator/` | Five-zone building physics, occupancy, outdoor climate and sensor simulation (attack simulation added later) |
| `docs/sample_output/` | Sample simulator output (JSON Lines) |
| `streaming/` | Kafka producer/consumer wrappers and topic definitions (named `streaming` so it does not shadow Kafka client libraries) |
| `processors/` | Stream processing, validation and feature engineering |
| `database/` | PostgreSQL schema and data access |
| `data_sources/` | Weather and carbon-intensity APIs |
| `ml/` | Energy prediction model (training, inference, evaluation) |
| `optimization/` | HVAC and lighting optimisation under comfort constraints |
| `security/` | Anomaly, attack and drift detection, alert management |
| `agent/` | Agentic AI (LangGraph) and safety validation |
| `routes/`, `templates/`, `static/` | Dashboard |
| `experiments/` | Baseline / optimised / attack comparison experiments |
| `docker/` | Kafka and PostgreSQL containers |
| `tests/` | Unit tests (pytest) |

## Setup (Windows)

Requirements: Python 3.10–3.13 (3.12 recommended) and Git. Docker Desktop is needed later
for Kafka and PostgreSQL.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/priy4nsh408/Energy_Optimization.git
cd Energy_Optimization
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env
```

On Linux/macOS, use `python3 -m venv .venv`, `source .venv/bin/activate` and
`cp .env.example .env` instead.

If PowerShell blocks `activate`, run
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once.

## Configuration

All settings come from environment variables. A local `.env` file is loaded automatically.
Real environment variables always override `.env`, and `.env` is git-ignored.
`.env.example` documents every variable.

`APP_ENV` selects the environment:

| `APP_ENV` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `development` (default) | Flask debug mode, `DEBUG` logging, random `SECRET_KEY` if none is set |
| `testing` | Database name gets a `_test` suffix, Kafka topics get a `test.` prefix, console-only `WARNING` logging |
| `production` | `SECRET_KEY` (≥ 32 chars) and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are required |

Invalid values (e.g. `FLASK_PORT=abc`) fail fast with a clear `ConfigurationError`.

In code:

```python
from config import get_config
cfg = get_config()
cfg.KAFKA.producer_config()            # dict for confluent_kafka.Producer
cfg.KAFKA.consumer_config("db_writer") # each service uses its own consumer group
cfg.KAFKA.topic("sensor.readings")     # physical topic name (with prefix)
cfg.DATABASE.connection_kwargs()       # kwargs for psycopg.connect
```

## Building simulator

The simulator (`simulator/`) models five independent zones and emits one timestamped
JSON event per zone per reading. It does not depend on Kafka or the dashboard: events go
to a *sink* callable (stdout/file now, a Kafka producer in the streaming module).

| Zone | Type | Area | Capacity | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Z1 Open-plan office | office | 300 m² | 30 | Lights follow the schedule (baseline waste) |
| Z2 Private offices | office | 120 m² | 8 | Lights follow occupancy |
| Z3 Meeting room | meeting | 60 m² | 12 | Hourly bookings, high ventilation |
| Z4 Cafeteria and lobby | cafeteria | 200 m² | 60 | Lunch peak, security lighting at night |
| Z5 Server room | server | 40 m² | 2 | 24/7 IT load and cooling |

**How the readings are produced (not random values):**

- **Temperature:** lumped RC heat balance covering the envelope, ventilation, people, appliances,
  lighting, solar gain and HVAC output.
- **HVAC:** proportional thermostat with a deadband. Outside operating hours it uses night setback
  (setpoint ± 4 °C). Electrical power = thermal output / COP + fan power, plus the energy the
  air handler spends dehumidifying ventilation air.
- **Humidity and CO₂:** moisture and CO₂ mass balances. Occupants add both; ventilation exchanges
  them with outdoor air.
- **Occupancy:** hourly weekday/weekend profiles per zone type, with day-to-day variation and
  gradual arrivals and departures. Meeting rooms use seeded hourly bookings.
- **Lighting:** daylight (from sun position and cloud cover) plus artificial lighting.
  **Appliances:** base load plus a per-occupant load with slowly varying fluctuation.
- **Outdoor climate:** seasonal and daily temperature cycle, sun position and slowly varying
  weather. *This is synthetic data*, used until the weather API module adds real data.
- **Sensors:** realistic noise, resolution and measuring range on top of the true physical state.
  The people counter occasionally miscounts by ±1, and one rooftop weather station serves all zones.
- **Reproducibility:** a fixed `--seed` reproduces a run exactly (apart from the wall-clock
  `emitted_at` field).

**Timing:** a reading is emitted every `interval_seconds` (1–5 s) of wall-clock time. Each reading
covers `interval_seconds × speed_factor` simulated seconds, integrated in physics steps of at most
60 s.

**Control interface:** `BuildingSimulator.apply_command(zone_id, setpoint_c=..., hvac_mode=...,
lighting_level=...)` is the only way other modules change the building.

```powershell
python -m simulator                                     # real time, settings from .env
python -m simulator --interval 1 --speed 60 --ticks 10  # 1 simulated minute per second
python -m simulator --speed 3600 --fast --ticks 24 --seed 42 --output data/day.jsonl
```
